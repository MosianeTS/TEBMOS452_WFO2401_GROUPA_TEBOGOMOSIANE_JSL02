# [JSL02] Submission: Debug the DOM

This is a project to debug a fitness tracker app. The requirement was to prevent the duplication of fitness goals added by a user. This was done by checking all the current goals and then checking for a duplicate.
If a duplicate goal was found, the goal is not added to the list of goals. If there is no duplicate, the goal is added to the list of fitness goals.
