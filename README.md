# [JSL02] Submission: Debug the DOM

This is a project to debug a fitness tracker app. The requirement was to prevent the duplication of fitness goals added by a user. This was done by checking all the current goals and then checking for a duplicate.
If a duplicate goal was found, the goal is not added to the list of goals. If there is no duplicate, the goal is added to the list of fitness goals.

## Reflections and challenges
Initially I had some bugs where a goal would be added twice or three times. After some online research and checking of my code, I came with a solution for that. Also, I was receiving two alerts when an existing goal was added and thats only because on the code, there were two alerts. That was fixed. It was a fun and challenging exercise.
